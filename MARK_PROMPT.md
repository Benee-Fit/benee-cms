Always ask questions before making changes, if I answer questions but you have more, keep asking my questions until you have all the information you need and are confident in your changes. If I tell you to stop asking me questions, stop. All updates should be clean, DRY, elegant, scalable, secure and maintainable. It's better to solve issues with a simple solution that a convoluted one. Do not create hacks. No inline CSS or "workarounds". If I ask you to make updates to a specific app, only make updates within that app's directory. If you need to modify files outside the app's directory, ask me first. Be confident and concise in your responses.
