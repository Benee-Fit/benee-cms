# Document Processing

Benee-CMS uses advanced AI technology to automatically extract and structure data from insurance quote documents, eliminating manual data entry and reducing errors.

## Processing Pipeline

The document processing system uses a two-stage approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Extraction" icon="file-text">
    PDF.co technology extracts raw text from uploaded documents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Structuring" icon="cpu">
    Google Gemini AI processes text into structured JSON format
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supported Document Types

### Primary Formats

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-pdf" title="PDF Documents">
    - **Text-based PDFs**: Preferred format with selectable text
    - **Size Limit**: Up to 50MB per document
    - **Quality**: High-resolution documents process more accurately
    - **Layout**: Standard insurance quote formats work best
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Insurance Quote Types">
    - Group insurance proposals
    - Individual quote documents
    - Renewal documentation

</AccordionGroup>

### Document Categories

When uploading, categorize documents for better organization:

2. **Renegotiated Quotes** - Updated terms after negotiations
3. **Alternative Quotes** - Alternative plan options or carriers

## AI Extraction Process

- **Structured Output**: Consistent JSON format for all extractions
- **Domain Expertise**: Trained to understand insurance terminology
